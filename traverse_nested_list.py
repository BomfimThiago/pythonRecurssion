# To count all the names in the list names
# we have to go through some steps:
# 1- Walk through the list, examining each item in turn.
# 2- If you find a leaf element, then add it to the accumulated count.
# 3- If you encounter a sublist, then do the following:
#    Drop down into that sublist and similarly walk through it.
#    Once youâ€™ve exhausted the sublist, go back up, add the elements from the sublist to the accumulated count, and resume the walk through the parent list where you left off.


# to know if a given list item is leaf item or not
# we can use isinstance()
print(isinstance(names[0], list))
# names[0] is not a leaf item of names
print(isinstance(names[1], list))
# names[1] is a leaf item of names
