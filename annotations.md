On the other hand, recursion isnâ€™t for every situation. 

Here are some other factors to consider:

*For some problems, a recursive solution, though possible, will be awkward rather than elegant.
*Recursive implementations often consume more memory than non-recursive ones.
*In some cases, using recursion may result in slower execution time.
